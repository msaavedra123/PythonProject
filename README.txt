Going into this project I wanted to represent a part of my community and something that is seen often but not addressed, for me, that topic was police brutality. I wanted to focus specifically on how that impacts the African-American community. There have been few days this year that we haven't seen or heard of a police shooting and we have seemingly become desensitized to the murders we see or are clouded by privilege and ignore what is going on around us. Originally, I was planning on having the names of victims be put into a list and randomized along with different charactersistics, saying they were kind or a teacher. But I came to the realization that is they were the names of actual victims the randomization of characteristics would make each statement untrue and paint a false narrative of the victims. I then decided to create a question answer quiz, in which the user would be asked about various events we hear in the news like terrorist attacks, mass shootings, and plane crashes in order to making it more shocking when the number of deaths caused because of police shootings, 987. Because the user would have no idea unless they had done similar research, if their answer is incorrect the program will print "Incorrect" along with the correct answer. If the answer is correct the program will simply print "Correct". Initially I had five different functions for each question, I attempted to create a class but was unsuccessful, and then finally I realized a list would be the best alternative and would minimize the amount of code I would be using. The list, questionList, contains each answer and question as tuples. The for loop iterates through each one and allows the user to answer the question using raw_input(), because raw_input() takes answers as strings, if the user types a letter it will simply print "Incorrect" instead of breaking. Finally, I wanted to add feeling to the stats and remind the reader of who those victims were instead of just giving them statistics, so I printed the letter BLM created by the names of some of the police brutality victims. BLM stands for Black Lives Matter, a nonprofit organization that takes action against instances of police brutality, the names used to form the letters included names from victims of 2018 and 2017, along with others like Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner. The statistics used in the questions were from 2017 because I wanted to use recent information and using the information from one year which contains only 365 days allows the user to think about the number of shootings that occur each day.

The information of police brutality victims comes from the website https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/sources which contains a database and allows users to narrow the names of victims by different factors like age, race, ethnicity, and whether they were unarmed. The statistics for each of the other questions originate from the article located at https://www.theroot.com/heres-how-many-people-police-killed-in-2017-1821706614 , it summarizes a each of the statistics and provides a link to their source.
